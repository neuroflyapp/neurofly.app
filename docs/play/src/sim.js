// The per-synapse efficacy of the two appended sensorimotor pathways (taste,
// antennal grooming). The core escape subgraph runs at 0.0002 per synapse, a
// scale tuned together with its tonic baselines: its neurons rest close to
// threshold and act through massive convergence (hundreds of LC4/LPLC2 onto
// the giant fiber). The appended pathways are sparse relay chains whose
// neurons are silent at rest; at the core's scale a two- or three-synapse
// chain cannot carry a signal at all. They are therefore modelled at the
// efficacy of the published whole-brain FlyWire LIF (Shiu et al. 2024): a
// synaptic event there adds 0.275 mV of conductance-like drive that decays
// with tau_syn = 5 ms into a membrane with tau_m = 20 ms, which peaks at
//   0.275 mV * 5/15 * (exp(-t*/20) - exp(-t*/5)) = 0.0432 mV   (t* = 9.2 ms)
// against 7 mV from reset to threshold: 0.0062 of threshold per synapse.
// This model deposits a postsynaptic potential instantaneously, so the peak
// is matched, not the charge (matching the charge, 0.0098, made the grooming
// pathway fire maximally at 4 Hz of receptor input). Every edge into or out of
// the core, and between the two pathways, keeps the core's scale, so the
// tuned escape circuit is not perturbed. A modelling choice, recorded in the
// run manifest.
//
// Within a pathway, the full strength applies to forward edges: from the
// receptors (layer 0) through the relay layers to the motor/command targets
// (layer 3). The ETL cut each pathway out of a recurrent brain along its
// strongest forward paths; the lateral and backward connections among the
// kept cells are real, but the inhibitory neurons that balance them in the
// whole brain were not kept. At full strength those loops latched — after
// one dusting, DNg12 kept firing at ~170 Hz indefinitely. With no recurrence
// the grooming pathway could not reach DNg12 at all. They therefore run at
// PATHWAY_RECURRENT_FRACTION of the forward strength, measured as the value at
// which grooming answers dust in a graded way and falls silent once the dust
// is gone. Together with the per-connection cap below (VALIDATION.md, 4
// seeds): JO-F drive 1.1 / 1.2 / 1.3 / 1.4 / 1.6 -> DNg12 ~3 / 8 / 15 / 25 /

// cells of the grooming pathway share ~700 contacts each way, so each spike
